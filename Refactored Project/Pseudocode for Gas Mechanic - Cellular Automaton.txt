const int TotalGas : keep track of total number of air "molecules" that are in the air (cummulative via forest)
varying int DiffusionTarget ? : assuming no external forces, the air should disperse evenly through the available 
area.  To calculate the diffusion target, we need to create a graph which allows forests and each unblocked tile 
is a node and only exists once in the graph.  Each forest will have it's a single diffusion target as well as 
the total .

We can find forests this way.
