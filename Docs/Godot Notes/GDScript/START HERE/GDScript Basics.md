## Introduction[¶](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#introduction "Permalink to this headline")

_GDScript_ is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language used to create content. It uses a syntax similar to [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) (blocks are indent-based and many keywords are similar). Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration.
