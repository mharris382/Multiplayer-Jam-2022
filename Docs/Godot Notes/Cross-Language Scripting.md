## Inheritance[¶](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/cross_language_scripting.html#inheritance "Permalink to this headline")

*A GDScript file may not inherit from a C# script. Likewise, a C# script may not inherit from a GDScript file*. Due to how complex this would be to implement, this limitation is unlikely to be lifted in the future. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/38352) for more information.
