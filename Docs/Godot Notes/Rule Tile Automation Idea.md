# Idea
- pull code from both auto collider (generate collision mesh from sprite) and automatic tileset creation tools.  Together it may be feasible to automate setting up colliders/occluders/navigation for tileset that use rule tiles.

# Goal
see if it is possible to modify the code in [QuickTileset](https://github.com/paradrogue/Godot-QuickTileset) or [TileSet Builder](https://github.com/HeavenMercy/TileSet-Builder-Godot-Plugin) so that it can handle autotiles
