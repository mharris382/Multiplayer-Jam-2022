so I made a new github repository to act as the official github repository for the steam eagles project moving forward but the more I think about it the more I think I should just include that project on this repository instead of making a whole new repository.  That makes more sense because the repository already contains the godot projects, and then we will have the entire commit history of this project attached to the new one.  The only thing that i really need to do is add the unity gitignore stuff to that project's gitignore
